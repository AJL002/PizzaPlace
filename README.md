# PizzaPlace
My final project for Introduction to Computer Science II created in NetBeans with Java and Swing.
-Check the Photos folder for screenshots of the program.

A POS system used for pizza places.

Features
- Place delivery or take-out orders.
- Search, sort, and load saved custoemrs.
- Menu contains pizza, deal specials, sides, drinks, and desserts.
- Customize pizzas depending on size, topping distribution, and amount.
- Calculates subtotal, tax, and total. 
- Accepts cash or card. 
- Writes a receipt (.txt) of completed transaction detailing the date and time, name, address, phone number, items ordered, and total + tax.

Issues
- Some functions are unavailable when the file is run from .jar. However, they all work fine when run from NetBeans.
- Sort function can sometimes crash after excessive use.
